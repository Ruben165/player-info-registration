A little project I did when I was learning about Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

This program functions to enter data on soccer players (not necessarily official players). This data will be stored in an ArrayList. Apart from entering data, this program can display data in the ArrayList, change data from the player, and delete the player's data from the ArrayList.

The program consists of 6 classes (1 'Main' class, 1 'Super' class = Player, and 4 'Sub' classes = Forward, Center, Back, and Keeper) and 1 interface = isHandOkay.

Note that the documentations are in Indonesian.
